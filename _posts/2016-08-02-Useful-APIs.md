### Machine Learning & AI

Leaf
: Neural Network and ML library for **Rust**, benchmarks as one of the fastest [http://autumnai.com/](http://autumnai.com/)

TensorFlow
: ML & Neural Network framework for **Python** [https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

Toch
: ML framework for **Lua** [http://torch.ch](http://torch.ch)

ClarifAI
: Image recognition as a service [https://www.clarifai.com/](https://www.clarifai.com/) has a limited free plan and paid tiers.

Parsey McParseface / SyntaxNet
: Google AI tensorflow-based natural language processing and semantic understanding framework/module [https://research.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html)


### Communication

Twillio
: (Two Factor) Authentication, Text and Voice telephony APIs, requires credit though they're hackathon friendly and often sponsoring hacks [https://www.twilio.com/](https://www.twilio.com/)

SendGrid
: Email-as-a-service, *much* easier than messing around with a mail server. [https://sendgrid.com/](https://sendgrid.com/)

PushBullet
: Push-notification service, as an app it does more than just being a channel for sending notifications but they have a good free API [https://docs.pushbullet.com/](https://docs.pushbullet.com/)

Hubot
: Pretty formidable chat-bot framework written in CoffeeScript (ewww...) that's well known on Slack and IRC [https://hubot.github.com/](https://hubot.github.com/)


### Media & Streaming

PyChromecast
: Python library for interfacing with Google Cast devices, [https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast](https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast)

OpenCV
: A very popular even if clunky computer vision system. Good for hard stuff like facial and [fiducial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiducial_marker) recognition. [http://opencv.org/](http://opencv.org/)

LaTeX
: Very good for typesetting, scripting PDF generation or manipulating documents [https://www.latex-project.org/](https://www.latex-project.org/)


### Web Development

Flask
: Simple and effective **Python** backend web framework [http://flask.pocoo.org](http://flask.pocoo.org)

Django
: Also a **Python** framework, more involved but sometimes easier to develop on-top-of than Flask [https://www.djangoproject.com/](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

Ruby on Rails
: Similar to Django but written in **Ruby** and arguably the nicer of the two. Has a similar batteries-included approach [http://rubyonrails.org/](http://rubyonrails.org/)

Bootstrap
: Easily the most popular frontend web framework, contains good HTML/CSS/JS primatives and components [http://getbootstrap.com/](http://getbootstrap.com/)

Materialize
: Similar to Bootstrap, less well known and *much* easier to use than Google's Polymer framework for Material Design (Andrioid style) [http://materializecss.com/](http://materializecss.com/)

Polymer
: Very involved & abstracted framework for building webapps in Material Design [https://www.polymer-project.org/](https://www.polymer-project.org/)

NodeJS
: No.


### Data Storage

Redis
: Really, really fast & scalable in-memory 'schema-less' datastore, feat. Hashmaps, Lists, Sets, Ordered sets and some niche but super handy Geospatial queries [http://redis.io/](http://redis.io/)

SQLite
: Probably the smallest SQL (Structured Query Language, for relational databases), easy to use, set up and hack with [https://sqlite.org/](https://sqlite.org/)

PostgreQL
: One of the more popular full-size SQL database engines [https://www.postgresql.org/](https://www.postgresql.org/)


### Hosting & Deployment

AWS
: Amazon Web Services, complicated but very capable, free credit sometimes available for Hackathons [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/)

Heroku
: Much simpler than AWS, very easy to get started with and has a Free tier [https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/)

DigitalOcean
: Server-based hosting, rather than containers like AWS and Heroku [https://www.digitalocean.com/](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

GitHub Pages
: Easy & free Static Site hosting with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)


### Hardware

Arduino
: Very well known and well supported hardware development ecosystem [http://arduino.cc](http://arduino.cc)

ARM Mbed
: More powerful than Arduinos, have RTOS features and a more complex/complete API [https://www.mbed.com/](https://www.mbed.com/)

Raspberry Pi
: Mini Linux computers with GPIO [https://www.raspberrypi.org/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)


### General

GitHub Student Develper Pack
: Loads of useful stuff and freebies [https://education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
