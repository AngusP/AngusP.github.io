Preamble
========

SDP is the System Design Project large practical run in the third year of Edinburgh University;s Computer Sicence course. The task is to build and develop a robot to play two-a-side footbal loosely based on the rules of the [RoboCup SSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCup_Small_Size_League). Teams have 10 members in two groups, one per robot. The System architecture, at an abstract level, is comprised of a Vision system, strategy AI/planner, Computer to Robot communications module and of course the Robot with it's hardware and firmware.
