Joined the company just before crowd funding begins, working on Firmware and dedicated 
control board hardware for the little biped robot 'Marty', using an ARM Coretex M4. 

I'm also developing APIs and integrations for the robot so it can be used with many 
popular environments, like Scratch, Python, C++ and 
[ROS](http://ros.org).
