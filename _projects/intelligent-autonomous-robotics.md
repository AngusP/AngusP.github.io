This task is inspired by ant navigation capabilities. The robot starts at a *'nest'* and must
search for virtual *'food'* in the environment, collect it and return it to the nest to gain points.

We imlemented Limultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) in the 2D environment
with the [Khepera II Robot](https://www.k-team.com/mobile-robotics-products/old-products/khepera-ii),
choosing to evolve a map as the robot explores rather than use a pre-configured static map.
