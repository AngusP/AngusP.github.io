Comprised of two parts, the design and development of an input <abbr title="Domain Specific Language">DSL</abbr> for [CAES](https://github.com/ewan-klein/carneades) developed by Ewan Klein.

Secondly, the system was extended to provide an adversarial argument evaluation system, with two prosecution and defence agents attempting to satisfy and defease a specified literal goal, over the argument set. This models burden of proof and multiple proof standards.
