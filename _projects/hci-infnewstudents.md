Tasked with building a website  that will be helpful to students who have 
recently been admitted to the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics.

The site must have a fairly complex set of designed interactions, and cover
a range of topics as identifies in a previous Affinity diagram.

Live site is [here](http://toaster.cc/inf4-hci-2), source code is
