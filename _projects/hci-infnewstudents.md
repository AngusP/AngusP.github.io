Tasked with building a concept website to help students who have recently
been admitted to the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics.

The site must have a fairly complex set of designed interactions, and cover
a range of topics as identifies in a previous Affinity diagram.

We produced a timeline checkbox concept and put emphasis on adhering to
the University of Edinburgh's design style and guidelines.

Live site is [here](//toaster.cc/inf4-hci-2), source code is 
on [GitHub](https://github.com/AngusP/inf4-hci-2) and 
[project report here.](//toaster.cc/inf4-hci-2/report/group.pdf)
