MLP is a two-semester practical course covering Machine Learning with neural networks, initially built from numpy, and then using TensorFlow.

The three courseworks entailed experimenting with different nets against the MNIST handwriting and CIFAR 10/100 image datasets.

To help speed up training and testing I built a workload distribution SSH bot, Pub/Sub and data streaming system using Redis, allowing many nets
to be trained at the same time on different lab machines, as well as live analysis & graphing.
