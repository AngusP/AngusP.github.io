Python Flask webapp, using Redis as a fast data store. 
I developed the SSH bot that concurrently connected to 
all the computers in the Lab, updating Redis with their 
availability, i.e. if someone was on them and who.

Winner *Best Use of Braintree PayPal API*, University of Nottingham
Information Services' *Best Hack* awards.

PayPal was used for a ransom-bid mechanic to cause a computer crash (for comedic
purposes only, and this feature went away quickly after the hack!)

Update in 2019: Still going strong, the School of Informatics has adopted the
project along with current-student contributors.
