Python Flask webapp, using Redis as a fast data store. 
I developed the SSH bot that concurrently connected to 
all the computers in the Lab, updating Redis with their 
availability, i.e. if someone was on them and who.

Winner Best Use of Braintree PayPal API, UoN Information Services Best Hack.
PayPal was used to ransom-bid a computer crash (for comedic purposes only, and this
feature went away quickly after the hack!)

Update in 2018: Still going strong, the School of Informatics has adopted the
project along with current-student contributors.
